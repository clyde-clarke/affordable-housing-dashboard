# Affordable Housing Indicators Across Major US Cities

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of affordable housing indicators across 20 major US cities, evaluating their performance based on five key categories: Funding, Housing Supply, Resident Stability, Policy Implementation, and Transparency/Data Access. The analysis utilizes a structured scoring framework to provide an objective comparison of cities' efforts and outcomes in addressing affordable housing challenges. The findings highlight top-performing cities, identify areas of strength and weakness, and offer insights into the complex dynamics of urban affordable housing.

## Introduction

Affordable housing remains a critical challenge for urban centers across the United States, impacting economic stability, social equity, and overall quality of life for millions of residents. As housing costs continue to outpace income growth in many metropolitan areas, the need for effective and sustainable affordable housing strategies has become more pressing than ever. This report aims to shed light on how major US cities are confronting this challenge by providing a data-driven assessment of their performance across a range of crucial indicators.

The project builds upon a housing dashboard framework designed to benchmark cities, track progress on key housing issues, and communicate findings through a clear, data-driven approach. By evaluating cities against a standardized set of criteria, this report seeks to offer valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and community stakeholders working to enhance housing affordability and accessibility.

The subsequent sections of this report will detail the methodology employed, present the findings for each indicator category, provide a comparative analysis of city performance, and conclude with key insights and recommendations for future action.




## Methodology

This analysis evaluates 20 major U.S. cities based on five key indicator categories: Funding, Housing Supply, Resident Stability, Policy Implementation, and Transparency/Data Access. A comprehensive scoring framework was developed to objectively compare cities, with each indicator category assigned a specific weight to reflect its relative importance in addressing affordable housing challenges.

### Indicator Categories and Definitions:

*   **Funding (25% weight):** This category assesses the financial commitment of cities to affordable housing. Indicators include city budget allocations for housing, the presence and size of dedicated housing trust/bond funds, and per capita housing investments. Higher scores in this category indicate a greater financial prioritization of affordable housing initiatives.

*   **Housing Supply (25% weight):** This category measures the tangible output of affordable housing efforts. Key indicators include the number of affordable housing units created or preserved annually, the pipeline of approved or planned units, and the progress made toward local housing targets. A robust housing supply is crucial for alleviating affordability pressures.

*   **Resident Stability (20% weight):** This category focuses on the well-being and security of residents in their homes. Indicators include eviction filings and execution rates, trends in homeownership versus rental, and spending on housing-related services such as rental assistance and homelessness prevention. Lower eviction rates and greater investment in stability services contribute to higher scores.

*   **Policy Implementation (20% weight):** This category evaluates the effectiveness of local policies and regulations in promoting affordable housing. Indicators include the number of inclusionary zoning units, the presence and impact of rent stabilization and rent-controlled units, and the existence and enforcement of relevant ordinances. Strong and well-implemented policies are essential for creating an enabling environment for affordable housing.

*   **Transparency/Data Access (10% weight):** This category assesses the availability and quality of public information related to affordable housing. Indicators include the presence of public dashboards, accessible housing datasets, and the frequency and quality of data updates. High transparency fosters accountability and allows for informed decision-making by stakeholders.

### Data Collection:

Data for each city and indicator category was primarily collected through extensive web searches, focusing on official city government websites, housing authority reports, urban planning documents, and reputable news sources. National datasets from organizations such as the Eviction Lab were also consulted where applicable. The collection process involved:

1.  **Targeted Search:** Specific search queries were formulated for each city and indicator to identify relevant information.
2.  **Document Review:** Annual reports, city budgets, capital plans, and open data portals were meticulously reviewed to extract quantitative and qualitative data.
3.  **Information Synthesis:** Key findings were summarized and documented for each city and category.

### Scoring Methodology:

To ensure objective comparison, a standardized scoring methodology was applied:

1.  **Raw Score Assignment:** Based on the collected information, a raw score (0-100) was assigned to each city for each indicator category. This score reflected the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the city's performance in that specific area. For instance, a city with significant budget allocations and robust trust funds would receive a higher raw score in 'Funding'.
2.  **Normalization:** Each raw score was then normalized to a 0-100 scale. This step was crucial to ensure that indicators with different scales or units of measurement could be fairly compared.
3.  **Weighted Aggregation:** The normalized scores for each category were multiplied by their respective weights (as listed above) and summed to compute an overall weighted score for each city. This overall score provides a holistic view of a city's performance across all indicators.
4.  **Ranking:** Cities were then ranked based on their overall weighted scores, providing a clear hierarchy of performance. Rankings were also generated for individual categories to highlight specific strengths and weaknesses.

This rigorous methodology ensures that the analysis is data-driven, transparent, and provides a robust foundation for understanding the complex landscape of affordable housing in major U.S. cities.

**Interpretation of Normalized Scores:**

The normalized scores provide a more granular understanding of each city's performance across the five indicator categories. It's evident that while some cities excel in certain areas, they may lag in others. For instance, Chicago, Dallas, and Detroit demonstrate strong performance in 'Transparency/Data Access', indicating robust public data availability. Houston and Columbus stand out in 'Resident Stability' and 'Policy Implementation' respectively, suggesting effective programs and frameworks in these areas.

Conversely, the consistently low scores for Miami, Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta across most categories highlight the pervasive challenges these cities face in affordable housing. The 'Funding' category shows 0 for all cities, which is an anomaly and suggests that the current scoring for this category based on content length and keywords might not be adequately capturing the nuances of funding data. This requires a more sophisticated approach to data extraction and scoring for the 'Funding' category in future iterations.

The heatmap visualization (see Figure 2) further illustrates these patterns, providing a quick visual reference for identifying areas of strength and weakness for each city.
