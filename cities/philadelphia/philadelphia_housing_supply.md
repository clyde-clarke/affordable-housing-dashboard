## Philadelphia - Housing Supply

Philadelphia faces a significant shortage of affordable housing units, with an estimated deficit of 64,500 affordable units, leading to many low-income residents being cost-burdened. The city's underproduction of housing units has been a persistent issue, with the underproduction total representing a notable percentage of total units in recent years.

To address this, Mayor Cherelle L. Parker's H.O.M.E. (Housing Opportunities Made Easy) Initiative aims to deliver 30,000 affordable housing units by 2030, marking the single largest and most ambitious housing plan in Philadelphia's modern history. This plan seeks to increase the supply of affordable housing and reduce homelessness. Additionally, municipal lawmakers are advancing legislation to speed up the approval process for affordable housing construction.

Organizations like LISC Philadelphia have contributed to increasing the supply by producing and preserving over 8,500 affordable homes. Despite these efforts, the city's supply of low-cost units remains inadequate to meet the needs of its low-income households.
