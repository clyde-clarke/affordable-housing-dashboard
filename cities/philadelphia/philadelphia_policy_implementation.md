## Philadelphia - Policy Implementation

Philadelphia has a robust framework for affordable housing policy implementation, spearheaded by Mayor Cherelle L. Parker's historic H.O.M.E. (Housing Opportunities Made Easy) plan. This comprehensive initiative aims to create and preserve 30,000 affordable homes through new construction, rehabilitation, and expanded programs.

The city is actively working to streamline the approval process for affordable housing projects. Legislation has been advanced to cut red tape and expedite the production of affordable housing, particularly for projects with long-term income restrictions. Philadelphia also has Inclusionary Affordable Housing Requirements, which authorize the city to promulgate regulations to implement affordable housing policies and determine affordability levels.

Beyond city-level efforts, Philadelphia benefits from state-level initiatives. Pennsylvania's first Housing Action Plan, created by Governor Shapiro, guides efforts to expand affordable housing and address homelessness, ensuring a coordinated approach. The city's policies also include making public land available at a lower cost to support housing affordable to low- and moderate-income families.
