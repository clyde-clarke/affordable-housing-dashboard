## Philadelphia - Transparency/Data Access

Philadelphia offers various resources for transparency and data access related to affordable housing. The city's OpenDataPhilly platform includes a dataset on "Affordable Housing Production," which details all DHCD-funded housing projects completed since 1994. This provides a clear overview of the city's efforts in housing development.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia provides a "Rental Housing Affordability Data Explorer," a tool that offers estimates of affordable rental housing availability at different income levels. This resource is valuable for understanding the current landscape of rental affordability.

Additionally, the city's "Philly Stat 360 Hub" provides key metrics on housing, including the number of affordable housing units built or preserved. The "Mixed Income Housing Program reports" document the city's use of zoning bonuses to support affordable housing. These initiatives demonstrate Philadelphia's commitment to making data accessible to the public and stakeholders, fostering transparency in its affordable housing programs.
