## Philadelphia - Funding

Philadelphia has made significant commitments to affordable housing funding. Mayor Cherelle L. Parker unveiled a historic $2 billion H.O.M.E. housing plan, aiming to create and preserve 30,000 homes. This plan relies heavily on municipal bonds, with the administration planning to issue $800 million in bonds over the next four years to fund affordable housing initiatives.

Local public sector entities in Philadelphia expended nearly $2.3 billion on housing over three recent fiscal years (2021-2023). The Philadelphia Accelerator Fund provides flexible financing for affordable housing and equitable neighborhoods, focusing on increasing capital access. LISC Philadelphia has also invested over $400 million, producing and preserving more than 8,500 affordable homes.

The city also has a Shallow Rent Program, launched in May 2020, which provides monthly rent vouchers to tenants in affordable rental units. The Housing Trust Fund has generated significant funding, with roughly $36 million between 2019 and 2023 through mixed-income programs.
