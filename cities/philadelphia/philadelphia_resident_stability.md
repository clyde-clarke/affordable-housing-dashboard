## Philadelphia - Resident Stability

Philadelphia is actively working to enhance resident stability within its affordable housing landscape through several key initiatives. The city's "Housing Opportunities Made Easy (H.O.M.E.)" plan directly addresses the challenges faced by low-income households in maintaining stable housing due to limited supply, aiming to provide safe, healthy, and quality affordable homes.

To prevent evictions and displacement, the "PHLRentAssist" program offers support to youth and families, helping them maintain stable housing. The City Council has also established the "Neighborhood Preservation Initiative (NPI)," a substantial $400 million program dedicated to expanding and protecting affordable housing, thereby contributing to long-term resident stability.

Furthermore, Philadelphia has taken legislative steps to safeguard tenants, including the approval of an "anti-displacement fund" for those forced to relocate due to property sales. New legislation also protects renters from income source discrimination, ensuring fair access to housing for individuals with vouchers. Organizations like Philly Tenant and Community Legal Services provide free legal assistance and support to renters, reinforcing tenant rights and contributing to a more stable housing environment.
