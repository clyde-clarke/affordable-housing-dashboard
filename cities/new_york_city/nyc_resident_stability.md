## New York City - Resident Stability (Initial Findings)

Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding New York City's resident stability:

**Eviction Filings and Execution Rates:**

*   Eviction Lab provides data for New York, NY. (Source: evictionlab.org)
*   NYC Council Data Team shows 2018 eviction rates by borough (e.g., Bronx: 1 Eviction per 79 Units). (Source: council.nyc.gov/data/evictions/)
*   The NYC Comptroller's office reported that Right to Counsel (RTC) representation rates dropped from 71% in FY21 to 42% in FY24, coinciding with climbing eviction filings. (Source: comptroller.nyc.gov)
*   Monthly evictions in NYC reached their highest rate since 2018, with an average of 9,531 households per month in the current year (compared to 10,500 in 2024). (Source: gothamist.com)
*   A source indicates that between 2013 and 2024, eviction filings decreased by nearly 50% (from 247,000 cases to 118,000). This seems to contradict the recent increase reported by Gothamist, suggesting a need for more precise data on specific types of filings or timeframes. (Source: civilrighttocounsel.org)

**Homeownership vs. Rental Trends:**

*   The share of households living in rental units in New York City decreased by 2 percentage points from 2011 to 2021 (from 68.7% to 66.7%). (Source: furmancenter.org)
*   Median rent has increased by 32%, while the median homeownership price has increased by 74%. (Source: comptroller.nyc.gov)
*   Renting has become a popular and economical option even for those who can afford to buy, as homeownership costs have soared. (Source: nytimes.com)
*   NYC's rental market is highly competitive, with 11 renters competing for each open apartment. (Source: nypost.com)

**Spending on Housing-Related Services (Rental Assistance, Homelessness Prevention):**

*   The City's main voucher program is the City Fighting Homelessness and Eviction Prevention Supplement (CityFHEPS). (Source: ibo.nyc.us)
*   The proposed Fiscal 2026 budget for the Department of Homeless Services is $3.58 billion. (Source: council.nyc.gov/budget)
*   CityFHEPS, a rental voucher program launched in 2018, cost over $1.1 billion in 2025. (Source: cbcny.org)
*   Rental assistance is highly effective but severely underfunded compared to need. (Source: cbpp.org)

**Next Steps:** Clarify the seemingly contradictory eviction data and look for more recent and comprehensive data on eviction execution rates. Also, try to find more specific figures on the total spending on rental assistance and homelessness prevention programs, and how many individuals or households are served by these programs.
