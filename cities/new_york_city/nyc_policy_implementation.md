## New York City - Policy Implementation (Initial Findings)

Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding New York City's affordable housing policy implementation:

**Inclusionary Zoning Units:**

*   New York City has an Inclusionary Housing Program (IHP), also known as Inclusionary Zoning, designed to promote and preserve affordable housing. (Source: NYC.gov HPD, NYU Furman Center)
*   The Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) program requires new buildings above 10 units or 12,500 square feet to include a set percentage of permanently income-restricted affordable units. (Source: NYC Department of City Planning)
*   The 421-a tax exemption program is also related to inclusionary housing. (Source: tandfonline.com)

**Rent Stabilization and Rent-Controlled Units:**

*   According to the 2023 NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey (HVS), there are approximately 24,020 rent-controlled apartments and about 960,600 rent-stabilized apartments in New York City. (Source: Rent Guidelines Board)
*   Rent control operates under the Maximum Base Rent (MBR) system in NYC. (Source: hcr.ny.gov)
*   The state agency NYS Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) administers rent laws. (Source: Rent Guidelines Board)

**Ordinances and Enforcement Related to Affordable Housing:**

*   The NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) is responsible for code enforcement. (Source: NYC.gov HPD)
*   The Tenant Protection Unit (TPU) preserves affordable housing by detecting and curtailing patterns and practices of landlord fraud and harassment through audits and investigations. (Source: hcr.ny.gov)
*   There are rules and eligibility requirements for the Affordable New York Housing Program (formerly 421-a). (Source: amlegal.com)

**Next Steps:** While I have a good overview, I should look for more specific data on the actual number of units created through MIH or other inclusionary programs annually, and any recent reports on the effectiveness of enforcement actions by HPD or TPU.
