## New York City - Transparency / Data Access (Initial Findings)

Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding New York City's transparency and data access concerning affordable housing:

**Availability of Public Dashboards, Housing Datasets, and Reporting:**

*   **Housing Plan Data Dashboard:** An ArcGIS dashboard visualizes the location of affordable housing initiatives and investments. (Source: arcgis.com)
*   **NYC Open Data Portal:** Provides datasets such as "Affordable Housing Production by Building" (updated quarterly) and a "Housing Database" which includes DOB-approved housing construction and demolition jobs. (Source: data.cityofnewyork.us)

**Frequency and Quality of Updates:**

*   Reports like the "2025 NYC Housing Tracker Report" from the New York Housing Conference provide annual updates on production. (Source: thenyhc.org)
*   There are reports indicating issues with housing quality and safety, particularly in public housing, suggesting that while data is available, the quality of housing it reflects may be a concern. (Source: cssny.org, climate.cityofnewyork.us)

**Next Steps:** The availability of data seems good. I will proceed to the next city, Los Angeles, and gather similar data.
