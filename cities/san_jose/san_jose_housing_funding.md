**Next Steps:** Need to find the current population of San Jose to calculate "per capita housing investments."




**Per Capita Housing Investments:**

*   San Jose City population in 2025 is approximately 997,368. (Source: California Demographics, Wikipedia)
*   San Jose received about $384 million from Santa Clara County's housing bond dollars.

**Calculation for Per Capita Investment (using the $384 million bond allocation):**

$384,000,000 (bond allocation) / 997,368 (population) â‰ˆ $385.02 per capita

**Note:** This calculation is based on a significant allocation from the Santa Clara County housing bond. Other budget allocations and grants would also contribute to the overall housing investment.
