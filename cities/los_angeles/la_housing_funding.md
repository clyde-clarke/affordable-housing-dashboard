## Los Angeles - Housing Funding (Initial Findings)

Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding Los Angeles's affordable housing funding:

*   **Budget Allocations:**
    *   The Los Angeles County 2025 Affordable Housing Needs Report indicates Housing Bonds and Budget Allocations of $754,400 (with a 6% increase from the previous year). (Source: chpc.net)
    *   Mayor Karen Bass' budget calls for a nearly 80% drop in city financing of new affordable housing units, declining from 770 homes in the current fiscal year to 160 homes in the next. (Source: laist.com)
*   **Dedicated Housing Trust/Bond Funds:**
    *   The Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) manages an Affordable Housing Managed Pipeline and acts as the primary issuer of tax-exempt and taxable multi-family housing bonds. (Source: housing.lacity.gov)
    *   The Local Housing Trust Fund (LHTF) program provides matching funds to local and regional housing trust funds. (Source: hcd.ca.gov)

**Next Steps:** Need to find the current population of Los Angeles to calculate "per capita housing investments."




**Per Capita Housing Investments:**

*   Los Angeles City population in 2024/2025 is approximately 3,878,704. (Source: California-demographics.com, Wikipedia, Census.gov)
*   Mayor Karen Bass' budget calls for a nearly 80% drop in city financing of new affordable housing units, declining from 770 homes in the current fiscal year to 160 homes in the next. This represents a significant reduction in direct city financing for new affordable housing.

**Note:** A precise per capita investment figure is difficult to calculate without a clear total investment amount for a specific fiscal year that directly correlates to the city's population. The budget reduction indicates a shift in funding strategy or reliance on other sources. The available data points to a decrease in direct city financing for new affordable housing units.
