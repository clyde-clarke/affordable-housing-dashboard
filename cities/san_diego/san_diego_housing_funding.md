Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding San Diego's affordable housing funding:

    *   The San Diego Housing Fund partners with investors, developers, and property owners to create affordable housing. (Source: sdfoundation.org)
    *   The State of California awarded $45 million to San Diego to support the creation of more than 1,180 affordable housing units. (Source: sdhc.org)

**Next Steps:** Need to find the current population of San Diego to calculate "per capita housing investments."




**Per Capita Housing Investments:**

*   San Diego City population in 2025 is approximately 1,389,672. (Source: World Population Review)
*   The State of California awarded $45 million to San Diego to support the creation of more than 1,180 affordable housing units.

**Calculation for Per Capita Investment (using the $45 million allocation):**

$45,000,000 (allocation) / 1,389,672 (population) â‰ˆ $32.38 per capita

**Note:** This calculation is based on a specific state allocation for affordable housing units. Other budget allocations and bond funds mentioned in the initial search would contribute to the overall housing investment, but a precise total for a single fiscal year is not readily available to calculate a comprehensive per capita figure. The $6.0 million reallocated from Affordable Housing Funds in the FY 2025 budget also represents a significant investment.
