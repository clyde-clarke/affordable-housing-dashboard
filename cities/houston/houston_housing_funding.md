## Houston - Housing Funding (Initial Findings)

Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding Houston's affordable housing funding:

*   **Budget Allocations:**
    *   The FY2025 Budget for the City of Houston includes funding to support the Housing and Community Development Department's mission. (Source: houstontx.gov)
    *   The Affordable Home Development Program facilitates the creation of single-family home communities. (Source: houstontx.gov)
    *   The Montrose TIRZ allocated 25% of its budget to support affordable housing within the district. (Source: kinder.rice.edu)
    *   The Houston City Council initially allocated no money towards housing in a federal recovery funds spending plan, but later increased it to $50 million after pushback. (Source: houstonpublicmedia.org)

*   **Dedicated Housing Trust/Bond Funds:**
    *   The Texas Housing Trust Fund provides loans and grants for affordable housing. (Source: tdhca.texas.gov)
    *   Uptown Development Authority raised $112 million in bonds, with about $53 million going towards funding the Choice Community. (Source: uptown-houston.com)
    *   There was a reported $1 billion discrepancy in Harris County Flood Bond Reports, which could potentially impact funding for various initiatives, though not directly tied to housing. (Source: texasscorecard.com)

**Next Steps:** Need to find the current population of Houston to calculate "per capita housing investments."




**Per Capita Housing Investments:**

*   Houston City population in 2025 is approximately 2,390,125. (Source: US Census Bureau, May 15, 2025)
*   The Houston City Council increased federal recovery funds for housing to $50 million.

**Calculation for Per Capita Investment (using the $50 million allocation):**

$50,000,000 (allocation) / 2,390,125 (population) ≈ $20.92 per capita

**Note:** This is a calculation based on a specific allocation of federal recovery funds. Other budget allocations and bond funds mentioned in the initial search would contribute to the overall housing investment, but a precise total for a single fiscal year is not readily available to calculate a comprehensive per capita figure.
