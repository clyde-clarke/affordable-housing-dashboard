Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding Phoenix's affordable housing funding:

*   **Budget Allocations:**

**Next Steps:** Need to find the current population of Phoenix to calculate "per capita housing investments."




**Per Capita Housing Investments:**

*   Phoenix City population in 2025 is approximately 1,675,144. (Source: World Population Review, ABC15.com)
*   The City of Phoenix allocated $2 million in one-time ARPA interest earnings to a new Housing Trust Fund in FY 2025-26.

**Calculation for Per Capita Investment (using the $2 million allocation to the Housing Trust Fund):**

$2,000,000 (allocation) / 1,675,144 (population) ≈ $1.19 per capita

**Note:** This is a calculation based on a specific allocation to a new Housing Trust Fund. Other budget allocations and bond funds mentioned in the initial search would contribute to the overall housing investment, but a precise total for a single fiscal year is not readily available to calculate a comprehensive per capita figure. The $1.2 million for legal assistance is also a direct investment in housing stability.
