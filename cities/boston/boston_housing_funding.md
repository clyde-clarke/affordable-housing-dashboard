## Boston - Funding

Boston has several initiatives and sources for affordable housing funding. Mayor Michelle Wu announced $40 million in grant funding available for affordable housing projects through two Request for Proposals (RFPs). The city also utilizes the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) which awards grants and low-cost financing for affordable housing creation and preservation. The Boston Housing Authority (BHA) partners with and receives grants from public and private organizations at local, state, and national levels.

Significant funding also comes from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund (AHTF) which supports housing for households with incomes not more than 110% of the median income. The Boston Acquisition Fund provides low-interest loans to nonprofits, community land trusts, and socially-minded developers to acquire tenanted multi-family properties. Additionally, the city launched a new housing accelerator fund to close financing gaps for approved projects. The state of Massachusetts also has the Affordable Homes Act, authorizing $5.16 billion in spending over five years for housing initiatives.
