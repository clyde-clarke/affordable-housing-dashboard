## Boston - Housing Supply

Boston is experiencing a significant housing supply shortage, characterized by a persistent mismatch between housing supply and demand. Reports indicate a chronic underproduction of housing units, with the number of households increasing at a faster rate than new housing units. For example, from 2010 to 2020, the number of households in Greater Boston increased by 10.7% while housing units only rose by 7.9%.

Efforts to address this include Mayor Michelle Wu's initiatives to add nearly 3,000 new permanently affordable homes and explore new social housing models. However, challenges remain, such as the drop in multifamily housing permits from 3,992 units in 2022 to 1,878 units in 2023. The city also faces high housing costs, with almost half of Greater Boston renter households paying more than one-third of their income on housing.
