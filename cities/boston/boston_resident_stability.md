## Boston - Resident Stability

Boston has established an "Office of Housing Stability" with the goal of putting residents on the path to housing stability. This office assists tenants in housing crises due to various reasons such as fire, natural disaster, eviction, or condemnation. It also provides information on emergency resources.

Furthermore, the city has developed an "Anti-Displacement Action Plan" which serves as a roadmap to confront residential, commercial, and cultural displacement. This plan aims to stabilize rents and shift existing housing from the speculative market to permanent affordability. The city also has a Housing Stabilization Fund (HSF) to support affordable rental housing initiatives.


Organizations like the Boston Tenant Coalition also provide resources and information regarding tenant rights, indicating a focus on protecting residents from displacement and ensuring housing stability.
