## Boston - Policy Implementation

Boston has a comprehensive approach to affordable housing policy implementation, outlined in documents like the "Boston Housing Strategy 2025." Key policies include the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP), which requires market-rate housing projects to support the creation of income-restricted housing, with increased on-site requirements for homeownership projects in certain zones.

The city also benefits from the state-level "Affordable Homes Act," a historic piece of legislation authorizing significant spending and including nearly 50 policy initiatives to counter rising housing costs and boost housing production. This act also establishes tax credit programs for qualified conversion projects.

Boston is exploring various strategies to increase affordable housing access, such as investing in and expanding social and cooperative housing, prioritizing housing for low-income individuals, and implementing zoning relief, tax incentives, and streamlined permitting processes. The city also aims to shift existing housing from the speculative market to permanent affordability through initiatives like the Anti-Displacement Action Plan.
