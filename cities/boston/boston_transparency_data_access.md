## Boston - Transparency/Data Access

Boston demonstrates a strong commitment to transparency and data access in affordable housing. The city maintains an "Income-Restricted Housing Inventory" dataset on Analyze Boston, which provides an inventory of all income-restricted units, including public housing. This data is maintained by the Mayor's Office of Housing (MOH) and is publicly accessible.

Further, the Massachusetts Housing Partnership (MHP) operates a "Center for Housing Data" which includes DataTown, an interactive website compiling community-level information for all Massachusetts cities and towns. Housing Navigator MA also serves as an official online listing and search tool for accessible and affordable rental homes in Massachusetts, contributing to data accessibility.

The Boston Housing Authority (BHA) provides public records access, including a "Resident Characteristics Report" with data on households living in federally-funded public housing or receiving housing subsidies. These initiatives collectively provide a robust framework for transparency and data access, enabling informed decision-making and public oversight of affordable housing efforts in Boston.
