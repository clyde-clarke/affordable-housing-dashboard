## New Orleans - Policy Implementation

The City of New Orleans, through the Office of Community Development (OCD), has programs addressing Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation (OOR) programs. These programs are designed to accomplish affordable housing preservation goals established in the Consolidated Plan and defined in the “Housing for a Resilient New Orleans” strategy for the Preservation of Affordable Housing: Substantial Rehabilitation (SR), Health and Safety (H&R), the Home Modification Program (HMP), and the Paint Program (PP).

Additionally, the page mentions an "Affordable Housing Dashboard" which visualizes OCD-funded affordable housing developments organized by affordability terms, address, and unit count. This dashboard allows users to filter and drill down on certain topics, and developments are displayed on a map based on location, funding expiration year, and number of affordable units. This indicates a commitment to transparency and data access related to affordable housing initiatives.
