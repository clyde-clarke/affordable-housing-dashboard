## New Orleans - Transparency/Data Access

New Orleans provides an "Affordable Housing Dashboard" which is a visualization of OCD-funded affordable housing developments. This dashboard organizes data by affordability terms, address, and unit count, allowing users to filter and drill down on specific topics. Developments are displayed on a map based on location, funding expiration year, and the number of affordable units. This indicates a strong commitment to transparency and accessibility of data related to affordable housing initiatives.

Furthermore, the city provides access to open City data via download or API, as mentioned on various city government websites. This allows for broader access to housing-related data for researchers, policymakers, and the public.
