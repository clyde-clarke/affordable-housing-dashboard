## Miami - Housing Supply

Miami-Dade County faces a severe affordable housing crisis, characterized by a significant supply shortage. Reports indicate a gap of 121,820 units that are affordable and available to renters earning 0-50% of the Area Median Income (AMI). The overall shortfall of affordable units for households earning about $75,000 and under is estimated to be 90,181.

Despite a significant overall housing supply, much of it is concentrated at the higher end of the market, doing little to alleviate the affordable housing shortage. The affordable housing sector in Miami has a strikingly low vacancy rate of 0.5%, highlighting the extreme demand. The county is projected to face a shortfall of affordable housing units by 2030.

To address this, Miami-Dade County is accelerating efforts to build more housing, particularly near transit hubs, and has identified 101 projects and 13,691 units in the pipeline that currently lack financing. The "Building Blocks" program aims to increase the supply of affordable and workforce housing.
