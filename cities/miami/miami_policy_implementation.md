## Miami - Policy Implementation

Miami has developed a comprehensive "Miami Housing Policy Toolkit" that outlines innovative policies, programs, and strategies aimed at preventing displacement and promoting affordable housing. The "City of Miami Affordable Housing Master Plan" quantifies the city's current housing landscape and provides data-driven strategies for addressing affordable housing needs.

Miami-Dade County is actively working to tackle the housing crisis, with Mayor Levine Cava focusing on ensuring safe and stable housing for residents. The county has approved its largest affordable housing project, the Little River District project, which will be the biggest affordable housing development in Miami-Dade County's history.

Key policy initiatives include the "Building Blocks for Housing Affordability" program, which aims to expand local protections and increase the supply of affordable and workforce housing. The city also utilizes the State Housing Initiatives Partnerships (SHIP) program to promote and create affordable housing opportunities for families and individuals. These efforts demonstrate a multi-pronged approach to policy implementation, combining strategic planning, large-scale development, and targeted programs to address the affordable housing crisis.
