## Miami - Resident Stability

Miami-Dade County is actively addressing resident stability amidst its affordable housing crisis. The "Building Blocks for Housing Affordability" program includes a committee specifically launched to prevent displacement and educate tenants on their rights. This initiative aims to provide residents with the knowledge and resources to navigate housing challenges.

The "Office of Housing Advocacy" in Miami-Dade County plays a crucial role in addressing issues related to affordable housing and landlord-tenant rights, offering resources and support to residents. Furthermore, there is a push for a "Tenants Bill of Rights" to better protect renters from predatory practices, with organizations like the Miami Workers Center advocating for stronger tenant protections.

Legal Services of Greater Miami also assists tenants facing eviction, illegal lockouts, or living with serious housing issues, providing crucial legal aid to ensure housing stability. These combined efforts demonstrate a multi-faceted approach to safeguarding residents and promoting stable housing conditions in Miami.
