## Miami - Transparency/Data Access

Miami-Dade County provides a "Housing Affordability Tracker," a Power BI report that offers data on upcoming developments, affordable units, workforce units, and development status. This tool enhances transparency by making key housing data accessible to the public.

The "Miami Affordability Project (MAP)" is an interactive online map that visualizes neighborhood-level housing dynamics, guiding data-driven decision-making. This project integrates county, local, and federal data to provide a comprehensive view of affordable housing distribution, demographics, and environmental factors.

Additionally, the City of Miami Open Data GIS platform includes a dataset on "Low Income Housing Units," providing geolocated information on affordable housing units within the city. Miami-Dade County also emphasizes transparency in government funds and provides access to county data, reports, and statistics through its transparency and open data initiatives. These resources collectively contribute to a more transparent and data-driven approach to affordable housing in Miami.
