## Miami - Funding

Miami-Dade County has secured significant funding for affordable housing initiatives. The "Building Blocks Fund" has raised $70 million in external commitments from nine funders to build and preserve affordable housing over the next three years. The county also established a Documentary Surtax program (Surtax) in 1984 to finance affordable housing development.

The City of Miami provides funding to developers for building and rehabilitating affordable rental housing for low- and moderate-income residents. Programs like the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) offer rental payment assistance to families. Miami-Dade County also received a $40 million federal grant to accelerate affordable housing efforts.

Despite these efforts, a study indicates that Miami-Dade County needs an additional $1.5 billion to fund 101 projects and 13,691 affordable housing units that are currently in the pipeline but lack sufficient funding. This highlights the ongoing need for substantial investment in affordable housing in the region.
