## Chicago - Housing Funding (Initial Findings)

Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding Chicago's affordable housing funding:

*   **Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP):** The 2025 QAP sets the City's evaluation criteria and process for awarding Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) to qualified rental housing developments. (Source: chicago.gov)
*   **Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Budget:** The CHA Board approved a $1.3 billion annual budget for 2025, which includes a Capital Grant Fund allocation (including projected carryover) totaling $150.8 million. (Source: thecha.org)
*   **Housing and Economic Development Bond:** A $1.25 billion bond aims to overhaul how the city handles development policy, with $360 to $390 million of these funds specifically aimed at construction and preserving 600 to 1,000 affordable rental homes. (Source: chicago.gov, southsideweekly.com)
*   **Department of Housing Appropriations:** The 2025 proposed Chicago budget includes a reserve balance of $151.14 million and $45.54 million for rehabilitation loans. (Source: bettergov.org)

**Per Capita Housing Investments:**

*   Between 2010 and 2020, Chicago ranked 40th in overall investment per household annually among the 100 largest US cities by population. (Source: apps.urban.org)

**Next Steps:** Need to find the current population of Chicago to calculate "per capita housing investments" more accurately.




**Per Capita Housing Investments (continued):**

*   Chicago City population in 2025 is approximately 2,611,867 (Source: worldpopulationreview.com, nchstats.com, census.gov).

**Calculation for Per Capita Investment (using Housing and Economic Development Bond):**

$360,000,000 (affordable housing portion of bond) / 2,611,867 (population) ≈ $137.8 per capita

**Note:** This is a calculation based on a portion of a bond specifically allocated to affordable housing. The "overall investment per household" mentioned in one search result (40th among 100 largest US cities) suggests a broader context of investment, but specific per capita figures for overall housing investment are not readily available in the initial search.
