## Seattle - Policy Implementation (Initial Findings)

Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding Seattle's affordable housing policy implementation:

**Inclusionary Zoning Units:**

*   **Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) Program:** Seattle has an MHA program that requires developers to either include affordable units in their developments or pay a fee for low-income housing development. This program has been in place since 2019. (Source: seattle.gov/sdci, publicola.com)
*   **Incentive Zoning (IZ) Program:** This is a voluntary program where developers provide specific amenities, including affordable housing, in exchange for extra floor area or height. (Source: seattle.gov/sdci, housingconsortium.org)
*   **Impact of IZ:** There are discussions and studies on the effectiveness of inclusionary zoning, with some suggesting it might lead to fewer overall housing units if not calibrated correctly. (Source: reddit.com/r/urbanplanning)

**Rent Stabilization and Rent-Controlled Units:**

*   **Statewide Ban:** Historically, Washington State has had a ban on rent control policies, meaning Seattle did not have rent control. (Source: propertymanagersseattle.com)
*   **Recent Changes (May 2025):** Washington State has recently enacted a new law that caps rent increases for most renters at either 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. This effectively introduces a form of rent control statewide. (Source: kiro7.com, stoel.com, reddit.com/r/SeattleWA)

**Ordinances and Enforcement Related to Affordable Housing:**

*   **Affordable Housing Design Review Amendments:** Legislation was passed (Ordinance 126854) that went into effect in August 2023, related to affordable housing design review. (Source: seattle.gov/sdci)
*   **Affordable Housing Impact Mitigation:** Chapter 23.58B of the Seattle Municipal Code provides for voluntary agreements for mitigation of affordable housing impacts associated with new commercial floor area. (Source: library.municode.com)
*   **First in Time Ordinance:** While SHA's federally subsidized housing is exempt, Seattle has a "First in Time" ordinance that generally requires landlords to rent to the first qualified applicant. (Source: seattlehousing.org)
