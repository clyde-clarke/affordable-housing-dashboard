**Next Steps:** Need to find the current population of Seattle to calculate "per capita housing investments."




**Per Capita Housing Investments:**

*   Seattle City population in 2025 is approximately 816,600. (Source: seattletimes.com, kuow.org)
*   The budget includes a historic investment of $685 million in affordable housing.

**Calculation for Per Capita Investment (using the $685 million investment):**

$685,000,000 (investment) / 816,600 (population) â‰ˆ $838.84 per capita

**Note:** This calculation is based on a significant investment in affordable housing. Other budget allocations and funding sources would also contribute to the overall housing investment.
