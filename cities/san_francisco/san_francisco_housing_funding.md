## San Francisco - Housing Funding (Initial Findings)

Based on initial search results, here's what has been found regarding San Francisco's affordable housing funding:

*   **Budget Allocations:**
    *   San Francisco has produced less housing for extremely low-income households (<30% AMI) because these units require additional rent or operating subsidies. (Source: sfplanning.org)
    *   Proposition G dedicates $8.25 million annually from the General Fund to subsidize extremely low-income housing from 2026 to 2046. (Source: spur.org)
    *   The White House's proposed budget could cut HUD funding to Bay Area counties by more than 44 percent, from $2.9 billion in 2023. (Source: urban.org)

*   **Dedicated Housing Trust/Bond Funds:**
    *   San Francisco voters approved a $600 million affordable housing bond in 2019. (Source: sf.gov)
    *   Proposition A authorizes the city to issue $300 million in general obligation bonds to fund the construction, development, acquisition, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable housing. (Source: spur.org)
    *   The Housing Trust Fund has effectively helped prevent thousands of San Franciscans from displacement by funding various initiatives. (Source: sf.gov)
    *   The 2024 $300 million bond aims to create new affordable housing, preserve existing housing, and expand homeownership, with $258 million for low-income housing. (Source: onesanfrancisco.org)
    *   A $20 billion affordable housing bond was removed from voters' ballots in August 2024 due to fears it wouldn't pass. (Source: calmatters.org)

**Next Steps:** Need to find the current population of San Francisco to calculate "per capita housing investments."




**Per Capita Housing Investments:**

*   San Francisco City population in 2025 is approximately 767,968. (Source: worldpopulationreview.com)
*   Proposition A authorizes $300 million in general obligation bonds for affordable housing.

**Calculation for Per Capita Investment (using the $300 million bond):**

$300,000,000 (bond) / 767,968 (population) â‰ˆ $390.63 per capita

**Note:** This calculation is based on a specific bond measure. Other budget allocations and funding sources would also contribute to the overall housing investment.
