## Atlanta - Policy Implementation

Atlanta has a clear strategic plan for affordable housing policy implementation, with a goal to create or preserve 20,000 affordable housing units between 2022 and 2030. This ambitious target is supported by various initiatives and programs.

The city has implemented an "Affordable Housing Action Plan" which aims to create/preserve 20,000 affordable homes by 2026, invest $1 billion, ensure equitable growth, and provide a pathway to affordable housing. The Atlanta Housing (AH) has its own strategic plan to create or preserve 10,000 affordable units by 2027.

Atlanta's approach includes efforts to expedite permitting processes for affordable housing and explore inclusionary zoning ordinances to mandate and incentivize affordable housing. The city has also established a Housing Strike Force to accelerate progress towards its affordable housing goals. These efforts demonstrate a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to policy implementation, aiming to address the city's affordable housing challenges.
