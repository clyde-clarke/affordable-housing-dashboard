## Atlanta - Funding

Atlanta has a robust ecosystem for affordable housing funding, with various initiatives and organizations contributing to its development and preservation. Atlanta Housing (AH) has been a key player for decades, providing affordable housing for low-income families. The GoATL Fund, managed by the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, includes an Affordable Housing Fund that directly invests in housing solutions.

The city also leverages federal programs like the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which is a significant block grant for creating affordable housing. The Atlanta Affordable Housing Fund (AAHF), a social impact fund, provides low-interest rate financing for transformative affordable housing projects, with investments from entities like the Annie E. Casey Foundation.

Invest Atlanta offers residential housing incentives, including the Housing Opportunity Bond Fund (HOB) for gap financing to address the need for affordable workforce housing. JPMorgan Chase has also committed $3.75 million to increase housing supply and affordability in Atlanta. The Atlanta Beltline Affordable Housing Trust Fund provides developer grants, further diversifying funding sources. These efforts highlight a multi-pronged approach to securing and deploying capital for affordable housing in Atlanta.
