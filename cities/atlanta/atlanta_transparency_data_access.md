## Atlanta - Transparency/Data Access

Atlanta has made significant strides in providing transparency and data access related to affordable housing. The "City of Atlanta Affordable Housing Tracker" is a web-based dashboard that offers real-time estimates of affordable housing production and preservation, making this crucial information readily available to the public.

HouseATL provides an "Affordable Housing Preservation Map and Toolkit," an interactive tool that examines subsidized affordable housing properties in Atlanta that are at risk of losing their affordability. This helps in identifying and prioritizing preservation efforts. Additionally, the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) offers an "Open Data & Mapping Hub" with accessible data and tools related to affordable housing.

The Atlanta Housing (AH) agency emphasizes accountability, ownership, transparency, and trust in its operations, as highlighted in a study by the Urban Land Institute. The Atlanta Fed also monitors rental affordability through its "Southeastern Rental Affordability Tracker." These initiatives collectively contribute to a more transparent and data-driven approach to addressing affordable housing challenges in Atlanta.
