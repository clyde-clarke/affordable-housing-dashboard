## Atlanta - Housing Supply

Atlanta is grappling with a severe affordable housing supply crisis, characterized by a significant loss of low- to moderately priced housing units. Between 2018 and 2023, the Atlanta metro area reportedly lost over 230,000 such units. This has led to a situation where, as of 2023, no state or metropolitan area, including Atlanta, had enough affordable and available homes to house its extremely low-income population.

Despite these challenges, the city is actively working to increase its affordable housing supply. The City of Atlanta Affordable Housing Tracker provides real-time estimates of affordable housing production and preservation. There are currently 40 public land projects underway, with 10,000 new affordable housing units either finished or under development. Atlanta Housing (AH) has been instrumental in providing affordable housing for decades, and the Atlanta Housing Board recently approved $105 million for affordable housing and resources, supporting 903 new affordable units.

JPMorgan Chase has also committed $3.75 million to increase housing supply and support greater housing affordability in Atlanta. While these efforts are significant, the ongoing loss of existing affordable units and the persistent demand highlight the need for continued focus on increasing and preserving the affordable housing stock.
