## Atlanta - Resident Stability

Atlanta is actively implementing strategies to enhance resident stability and prevent displacement, particularly in the context of its rapidly changing housing market. The city recognizes the loss of affordable homes and its impact on families, leading to displacement.

Key initiatives include the "Legacy Resident Retention Program (LRRP)" which provides property tax relief to homeowners in areas affected by rising property values, aiming to protect long-term residents from being priced out of their homes. Invest Atlanta has also opened an "Anti-Displacement Tax Relief Fund Program" for eligible senior residents citywide.

Atlanta Housing (AH) is working to help more residents achieve self-sufficiency and provides housing assistance to low-income working families, seniors, persons with disabilities, and those with special needs. Furthermore, Georgia has passed new tenant protection laws aimed at safeguarding renters from subpar living conditions and ensuring minimum habitability standards. Organizations like LISC Atlanta are also working to preserve affordable housing in gentrifying neighborhoods and increase the supply of stable, affordable rental housing.
